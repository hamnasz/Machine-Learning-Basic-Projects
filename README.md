## 🧠 Project Name  
**Study Session Sweet Spot: Predicting Study Effectiveness from Session Attributes**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
You aim to predict **how effective** a study session is based on **variables like session timing, length, break habits, distractions, and noise level**. The goal is to uncover patterns and provide recommendations for an individual (or generalized) optimal study setup.

---

## 📈 Type of Model  
**Linear Regression**, with possible tweaks (Ridge, Lasso, or Polynomial) if needed to better capture relationships.

---

## 🔍 Target Variable (What you're predicting)  
You have two great options:
1. **Self-rated effectiveness** (scale of 1–10) — easy to collect through Google Forms/journaling.
2. **Post-study quiz score** (e.g. a mini test or spaced recall) — more objective but needs consistent quiz creation.

Choose one or combine both as dual targets.

## 🧾 Features (Independent Variables)  
Here’s a breakdown of features you can collect and why they matter:

| Feature              | Type        | Example Values                | Why It Matters                      |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Time of day          | Categorical or Numeric | Morning, Afternoon, Night / 8:00 AM | Circadian rhythm affects alertness |
| Session length       | Numeric     | 45 mins, 90 mins              | Duration sweet spot might exist     |
| Number of breaks     | Numeric     | 0, 1, 2                       | Breaks can help or hinder focus     |
| Break duration       | Numeric     | 0 mins, 5 mins, 15 mins       | Long breaks might reduce flow       |
| Background noise     | Numeric or Ordinal | 0 (silent), 1 (soft), 2 (loud café) | Noise level impacts focus differently |
| Device usage         | Numeric     | 0 (none), 1 (music only), 2 (phone multitask) | Screens can be distracting          |
| Sleep from last night| Numeric     | 6.5 hours                     | Sleep directly impacts cognition    |
| Study environment    | Categorical | Desk, Couch, Library          | Environment cues matter             |
| Type of task         | Categorical | Reading, Coding, Flashcards   | Different tasks demand different focus |

> You can start simple with 5–7 key features, then expand.

## 🧪 Data Collection Plan (DIY)  
- Use **Google Forms** or Notion to log each session.
- Include dropdowns/sliders for easy entry (e.g., time of day, breaks taken, focus rating).
- If doing quizzes, prepare short post-session questions (maybe 3–5) on what you just studied.

**Alternative**: Build a mini web app or use a Telegram bot to log data quickly.

---

## 📊 EDA Ideas (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
- Plot effectiveness vs. time of day.
- Heatmaps of feature correlations.
- Bar plots of effectiveness by study environment.
- Line plots showing trends over time for personal improvement.

---

## 🔧 Model Evaluation Metrics  
- **MAE / RMSE** for regression accuracy.
- **R² score** to understand how much variance is explained by your model.

---

## 🚀 Extensions (Bonus Ideas)  
- Use **ridge or lasso regression** if there are too many features or multicollinearity.
- Use **clustering (e.g. KMeans)** to group study sessions and find patterns.
- Deploy as a web dashboard that suggests:  
  _“Your most productive time is 9–11 AM with 10-minute breaks in quiet environments.”_

---

## 📌 Potential Challenges  
- Subjectivity in self-ratings — can be inconsistent.
- Need enough variation in data to learn good patterns (try at least 30–50 sessions).
- Noise level and device use may be hard to quantify — define scales clearly upfront.
