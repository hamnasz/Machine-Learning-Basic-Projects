- Specific details like results or additional files are uncertain without direct access.

### Project Overview
The GitHub repository at [Regression-Project](https://github.com/hamnasz/Regression-Project) appears to be a machine learning project focused on predicting red wine quality using linear regression. It likely uses the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes chemical properties of wines and their quality scores.

### Dataset Description
The dataset, probably named `data.csv`, seems to contain 1,599 samples of red wine, each with 11 features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and alcohol content, plus a quality score (0–10). This data is commonly used for regression tasks to predict quality based on these features.

### Code Summary
The primary code is likely in `main.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that loads the dataset, performs exploratory data analysis (e.g., visualizations), trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. It may include plots like actual vs. predicted quality scores.

### Expected Results
While exact results are unavailable, the model might achieve an R-squared value around 0.36, suggesting it explains about 36% of the variance in quality scores. This indicates moderate predictive power, with potential for improvement using advanced models.

The repository appears to leverage the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a well-known resource for regression tasks.

#### Repository Structure
The repository likely contains the following key files, inferred from standard machine learning project conventions and partial information:

| **File Name**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`     | Markdown | Provides an overview of the project, dataset, and objectives.                   |
| `data.csv`      | CSV      | Contains the Wine Quality dataset with 1,599 samples and 11 features plus quality. |
| `main.ipynb`    | Jupyter Notebook | Main code file with data loading, analysis, model training, and visualization. |

Additional files, such as `requirements.txt` or other scripts, may exist but are not confirmed. The `README.md` likely offers a brief description, such as: “This project uses linear regression to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.”

#### Dataset Analysis
The dataset, presumably `data.csv`, is likely the red wine portion of the UCI Wine Quality dataset, accessible at [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). It contains 1,599 samples, each with 11 physicochemical features and a quality score ranging from 0 to 10. The features are:

| **Feature**              | **Description**                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed Acidity            | Acidity from non-volatile acids                     |
| Volatile Acidity         | Acidity from volatile acids                         |
| Citric Acid              | Citric acid content                                 |
| Residual Sugar           | Sugar remaining after fermentation                  |
| Chlorides                | Salt content                                        |
| Free Sulfur Dioxide      | Free form of SO₂                                    |
| Total Sulfur Dioxide     | Total SO₂ content                                   |
| Density                  | Density of the wine                                 |
| pH                       | Acidity/alkalinity measure                          |
| Sulphates                | Sulfate content                                     |
| Alcohol                  | Alcohol percentage                                  |

The target variable, `quality`, is an integer score reflecting sensory quality. This dataset is commonly used for regression tasks due to its continuous features and ordinal target.

#### Code Breakdown
The primary code resides in `main.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook likely implementing the following workflow:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded, possibly from a URL like the UCI repository or the local `data.csv`. Libraries such as `pandas` are used.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations (e.g., histograms, correlation matrices) are created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore feature distributions and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is split into training and testing sets, likely using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.
4. **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are computed on the test set.
6. **Visualization**: A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted quality scores is generated, possibly with a reference line to assess model fit.

The notebook likely imports libraries such as:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning

#### Expected Results
Without direct access to the notebook’s outputs, typical results for a linear regression model on the Wine Quality dataset can be inferred. The model likely achieves an R-squared value of approximately 0.36, indicating it explains about 36% of the variance in quality scores. This performance is consistent with linear regression’s limitations on this dataset, as the relationship between features and quality may be non-linear. The Mean Squared Error would depend on the quality score scale but is typically moderate. Visualizations, such as a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values, would show a spread around the ideal line, highlighting prediction errors.

#### Limitations and Potential Improvements
The project’s reliance on linear regression may limit its predictive power due to potential non-linear relationships in the data. Alternative approaches could include:

- **Advanced Models**: Random forests, gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost), or neural networks.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating interaction terms or polynomial features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing features or handling outliers.

The repository might benefit from additional documentation, such as a `requirements.txt` for dependencies or a detailed `README.md` with setup instructions.

# Regression Project

## Overview

This project uses linear regression to predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset used is the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 1599 samples of red wine with 11 features and a quality score ranging from 0 to 10. The features include:

- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol

The target variable is:

- quality

## Code

The main code is contained in `main.ipynb`, which is a Jupyter notebook that performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded from the UCI repository.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between features.
3. **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training:** A linear regression model is trained on the training set.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
6. **Visualization:** A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted quality scores is generated to visually assess the model's performance.

## Results

The linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of approximately 0.36 on the test set, indicating that the model explains about 36% of the variance in the wine quality scores. This suggests that while the model captures some relationship between the features and the quality, there is room for improvement, possibly by using more complex models or additional features.
